# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As we don't have multi-version releases, only the latest `develop` and `master` versions support security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting security vulnerabilities, we strongly encourage including steps to reproduce, relevant screenshots, and OS/browser used if applicable.
Reports that can't be reproduced will be closed.

The following options are available for you when reporting a vulnerability:

1. Report a vulnerability under the **Security** tab
2. Email us at [hello@robox.com.au](mailto:hello@robox.com.au)
