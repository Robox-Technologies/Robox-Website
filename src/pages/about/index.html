                    <strong>STEM education should be for everyone.</strong><br>
                    At Ro/Box, our mission is to make hands-on engineering and coding education more affordable and accessible to all students,
                    regardless of their background or resources.
                    We are greatly motivated by the opportunities of STEM and robotics,
                    and believe the future belongs to creators, problem-solvers, and innovators.
                    By breaking down the financial barriers to robotics, we hope to open the door for everyone to experience the opportunities
                    and love for robotics we have.

                <p>
                    Ro/Box began as a project for the Rise Challenge,
                    a challenge that selects 100 young people globally for global impact.
                    The project focused on tackling the high cost of robotics in STEM education.
                    We’ve always been passionate about robotics, but consistently shocked by how expensive most robotics kits are.
                    These high prices pose serious challenges for schools and limit access to STEM learning for countless students.
                    <br><br>
                    We believe that by lowering the cost of robotics—
                    and reducing the barrier to entry into STEM—
                    we can directly support schools and increase student engagement.
                    Over time, we hope this will give more and more students the opportunity to fall in love with robotics the same way we did.

                    To prove this, we created Ro/Box:
                    an ultra-affordable robotics kit designed to make STEM accessible to any student, anywhere.
                    To complement it, we’ve developed a free companion website filled with guides,
                    learning resources, and a block coding editor—
                    making it easy and inviting for anyone to start exploring engineering and programming with Ro/Box.

                        we'd love your support in helping us realise our vision.
                        You can build your own Ro/Box, use our free resources, or help spread Ro/Box to classrooms that need it most.
                        Together, we can give every child the opportunity to discover, and create the dream of robotics.
