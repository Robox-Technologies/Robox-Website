## Testimonial

## **“We recently had the Ro/Box Robotics Kit demonstrated to us in a Year 8 Digital Technologies classroom and it was an instant hit with the students. It's designed for beginners and offers a perfect hands-on introduction to robotics and coding. The students loved watching their robot draw lines on paper around the classroom. The block-based coding interface made it easy for everyone to get involved.**
## **What stood out most was that the kit sparked curiosity and problem solving. It's affordable, easy to use and a great way to bring robotics to life in the classroom.”**
